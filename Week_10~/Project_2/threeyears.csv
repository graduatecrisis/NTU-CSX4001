That first step will lead to a path of vengeance against the very Cipher that slaughtered so many of Snake's men, and to a battle that will embroil the whole world...

As players enter their humble town after finding their crown, they are assisted by their advisors, especially Howzer, in taking on missions in the immediate area of town. With the success of each, as well as activities like farming and natural resources development, they will gain wealth in the form of in-game currency called 'Bol.' Once an essential infrastructure has been established in town a suggestion box is set up through which in-game characters can make quest suggestions to supplement those of your advisors. During quests players in the role of young King Corobo can control multiple subjects of his kingdom who follow and serve based on your kingly status. These subjects have different professions which come in handy in specific as well as general quest scenarios and should be chosen wisely. Additional training facilities can be constructed to retrain existing subjects as well as those that are added to your kingdom as it prospers and eventually needs to expand into surrounding territories. The world of Little King's Story is expansive and set on many levels. Although each level contains multiple possible boss battles, progression through the game levels always requires the defeat of a substantial boss. Battles become more intense as you set out to conquer the lands that surround your kingdom, although these are never too overbearing due to the game's easy to alter difficulty settings. As these campaigns against neighboring kingdoms proceed you are kept aware of the health and happiness of your subjects at home and that of your troops via an information bar at the top left, as well as a ticker scrolling across the screen. Balance their needs with the needs of an expanding kingdom and you may indeed become the best king ever.

                            Among the nations on the Zemurian continent, the mighty Erebonian Empire has been quick to stake its claim militarily; yet politically, ugly bouts of internal conflict between the upper class and commoners struggling to rise to power have been steadily intensifying with each passing month. The Noble and Reformist Factions have been none too kind to one another over the years, and tensions between the two only stand to worsen if compromises aren't reached in the very near future.

Rean Schwarzer, like any other citizen of the Imperial nation, is no stranger to these rising conflicts: the class system has been deeply interwoven into the tapestry of Erebonian culture since the days of old. As a seventeen-year-old student preparing for his new life at Thors Military Academy, however, he notices that his crimson uniform differs from the standard outfits issued to his peerstypically green for commoners, and white for nobles.

Enter, Class VII of Thors Military Academy. For the first time in the prestigious academy's history, rank means nothing and skill means everything. With nine hand-picked students of various backgrounds and abilities, Rean included, Class VII readies itself to dive deep into the political quagmire that threatens not only them, but the very foundations of the Empire.
